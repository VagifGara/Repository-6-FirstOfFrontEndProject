                        The </span>Barrett M82 is a 
                        <a href="https://sniperpedia.com/best-airsoft-semi-auto-sniper-rifles/">semi-automatic</a> anti-material rifle, 
                        designed and developed by Barrett Firearms Manufacturing company. 
                        Development of this powerful anti-material rifle began in the early 
                        1980s. Working versions were ready by 1982, hence the designation 
                        M82. It is worth noting that the M82 is a company designation, 
                        rather than a US military designation. The company successfully sold 
                        100 rifles to Swedish Armed Forces in 1989. In 1990-1991 US Marine 
                        Corps obtained around 125 of these rifles. Soon followed orders from 
                        the US Army and Air Force. Today this anti-material rifle is in 
                        service with nearly 60 countries 
                        and used by military and law enforcement forces. In a number of countries this anti-material rifle is 
                        used as a long-range anti-personnel sniper weapon.</font></p>

                        <font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; This rifle was designed to destroy sensitive enemy equipment, like 
                        parked aircraft, radar units, trucks and various other important 
                        assets at long range. It is used for remote destruction of 
                        explosive ordnance. Even though it was originally designed as an 
                        anti-material rifle, the Barrett M82 is also used as a long-range 
                        sniper rifle. It can neutralize enemy snipers at standoff range. This 
                        rifle can be also used to hit enemy soldiers, that are hiding behind 
                        cover and walls, as its powerful ammunition can penetrate through 
                        bricks and concrete. However the Barrett M82 is primarily used as 
                        anti-material weapon.</font></p>

                        Scharfschutzengewehr 69, or SSG 69 is an Austrian sniper rifle. 
                        Externally it resembles a hunting rifle, however it 
                        was specially designed as a weapon for military and law enforcement forces. 
                        Since the mid 1960s the Austrian Army was looking for an advanced 
                        sniper rifle to equip its own snipers. In 
                        1969 the rifle designed by Steyr was adopted by the Austrian Army as a standard 
                        sniper weapon, hence its designation. After the break up of the Steyr-Daimler-Puch company, its firearm manufacturing division 
                        became independent. Since 1987-1989 this sniper rifle was produced 
                        by Steyr Mannlicher. Eventually this weapon 
                        made its name for impressive accuracy and was adopted by a number of countries from all over the world, where 
                        it is used by military or law enforcement forces. Currently the SSG 
                        69 is one of the most popular sniper rifles in the world. Export 
                        operators include Argentina, Chile, Greece, India, Indonesia, 
                        Ireland, Jordan, Netherlands, Pakistan, Peru, Saudi Arabia and 
                        Turkey. This sniper rifle is even used by a US BORTAC border patrol 
                        unit. This weapon saw 
                        action during numerous wars and military conflicts. The SSG 69 was 
                        produced without changes for more than 40 years. Its production ceased 
                        only in 2015. It was succeeded by a modern SSG 08 
                        sniper rifle.</font></p>

                        SSG 69 is a bolt-action weapon. It is chambered for a standard NATO 
                        7.62x51 mm (.308 Winchester) cartridge. At the time of its 
                        introduction in the late 1960s this weapon was different than most contemporary sniper 
                        rifles. Design of the SSG 69 was rather unique. Some of its features 
                        were cutting-edge back in the late 1960s. It 
                        used synthetic materials for light weight and cold hammer-forged barrels for

                        rifle uses an unusual detachable rotary magazine, that holds 5 
                        rounds. The&nbsp; magazine is transparent, so it is easy to see 
                        how many rounds are loaded. The magazine is released by squeezing 
                        two release buttons on either side of the magazine. A larger 
                        10-round box magazine was available as an accessory. It protrudes 
                        down bellow the rifle.</font></p>

                        made of fiberglass. Back in the late 1960s it was a novelty, as most 
                        other rifles had wooden stocks. Contemporary weapons, that were 
                        adopted during similar time frame, including the US Army's M21, 
                        USMC's M40 and German Mauser SP66, all had wooden stocks. So even 
                        though the SSG 69 may not have been the first rifle with a synthetic 
                        stock, but it was certainly pioneering that Steyr was using this 
                        feature as standard. The buttstock is hollow to keep the weight 
                        down. Also the buttstock has a spacer system, that allows for 
                        adjusting the length of pull by adding or removing spacers.</font></p>

                        is popular due to its accuracy. The Steyr SSG 69 demonstrated sub 
                        0.5 MOA accuracy during several international competitions. Back in 
                        the late 1960s just a few custom rifles were sub-MOA accurate. The 
                        SSG 69 is normally used with a scope. Originally Austrian Army 
                        rifles were paired with Kahles ZF69 6x magnification scopes. With 
                        this scope the rifle was effective out to 600 meters. Later a Kahles 
                        ZF84 10x magnification scope was adopted. It extend effective range 
                        of the rifle out to 800 meters. There are auxiliary iron sights for 
                        emergency use.</font></p>

                        accuracy the SSG 69 can not match ergonomics of modern rifles. It 
                        lacks a proper pistol grip, fully adjustable stock or Picatinny-type

                        Despite the fact that the SSG 69 is out-dated, it remains a very

                        Warfare Magnum (AWM) is a British sniper rifle. It is a product of 
                        Accuracy International company. It is a more powerful version of the Arctic 
                        Warfare sniper rifle, designed to use larger and more powerful 
                        Magnum-type cartridges. The word "Magnum" in the designation denotes 
                        the Magnum chambering. There are two main versions of this weapon, 
                        chambered for .300 Winchester Magnum and .338 Lapua Magnum 
                        ammunition. This weapon was adopted in 1996. Version chambered for 
                        .300 Winchester Magnum is in service with the 
                        Czech Republic, Germany (locally designated as the G22), and some 
                        other countries. Another version, chambered for .338 Lapua Magnum 
                        was adopted by at least 14 countries, including Ireland, Israel, 
                        Italy, Malaysia, Netherlands, Norway, South Korea, and the United Kingdom. This sniper rifle saw action during wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.</font></p>

                        similar to the original Arctic Warfare sniper rifle, but has a 
                        longer bolt to accommodate the larger and more powerful Magnum-type 
                        ammunition. This weapon has a stainless steel 660 mm (26") barrel.

                        (7.62x67 mm) cartridge was originally designed as a hunting 
                        ammunition. It has a flatter trajectory and 
                        significantly increased muzzle velocity, wind resistance and 
                        supersonic range than the standard NATO .308 Winchester (7.62x51 mm) 
                        cartridge. As a result it has significantly longer effective range. 
                        The Arctic Warfare Magnum rifle chambered for 
                        this ammunition has an

                        <font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; Another version, chambered for the .338 Lapua Magnum, is much more 
                        powerful. This cartridge was specially designed for military snipers 
                        as long-range sniping ammunition. Its effective range is comparable 
                        with that of .50 BMG (12.7x99 mm) cartridge, though the .338 Lapua 
                        Magnum develops significantly less kinetic energy and penetration. 
                        It outperforms the .300 Winchester Magnum version. The Arctic 
                        Warfare Magnum rifle, chambered for this ammunition, has an 
                        effective range of 1 500 - 1 700 meters.&nbsp; In some cases the 
                        .338 Lapua Magnum round can reportedly penetrate armored glass. This 
                        weapon is one of the best sniper rifles in the world. In fact in 
                        2009 the second longest sniper kill in history was made with the 
                        <a href="http://www.military-today.com/firearms/l115a3.htm">L115A3</a> rifle (British version of the Arctic Warfare Magnum) in 
                        Afghanistan. A British Army sniper Craig Harrison killed two Taliban 
                        fighters at a range of 2 475 meters. At the time it was the longest

                        M95 is a manual bolt-action anti-material and sniper rifle, designed 
                        by Barrett Firearms Manufacturing company. It is an improved 
                        production version of the Barrett M90. The major difference is that 
                        the pistol grip with the trigger have been moved slightly forward 
                        for better magazine clearance. Thus the new weapon is more 
                        comfortable to use. In 1995 the Barrett M95 replaced in production 
                        the original Barrett M90. The M95 is a company designation, rather 
                        than a US military designation. The number in the designation 
                        denotes the year 1995, when a working version of the rifle was 
                        ready. This weapon is proposed as a lighter, more compact and 
                        manually-operated alternative to the semi-automatic
                        <a href="http://www.military-today.com/firearms/barrett_m82.htm">
                        Barrett M82</a>. It is intended for elite military and law 
                        enforcement units. In 1999 this weapon was selected for a US Army 
                        trials to become the new XM107. A small number of these rifles were 
                        purchased for trials and evaluation, however eventually the Barrett 
                        M82 was selected. Still though the Barrett M95 was adopted by a 
                        number of countries from all around the world. The Barrett company 
                        announces that this sniper rifle is used by 15 countries. This 
                        weapon is used by Argentina, Austria, Denmark, Finland, Greece, 
                        Georgia, Italy, Jordan, Malaysia, Philippines, Spain, Thailand, 
                        Turkey, and some other countries. However the Barrett M95 could 
                        never match the popularity of the original Barrett M82, that is in 
                        service with nearly 60 countries. As of 2017 the Barrett M95 is

                        avoided, as the lackluster quality of these rounds results in poor 
                        accuracy. Match grade ammunition includes the M118, M118LR, and MK 
                        316 MOD 0 "Special Ball, Long Range", and many others. The "long 
                        action" design of the M24 also allows it to be reconfigured to fire 
                        larger rounds, and variants chambered in .300 Winchester Magnum and 
                        .338 Lapua Magnum have been developed to exploit this capability. 
                        The effective range of the M24 is 800 m, though shots have 
                        successfully been made at beyond 1 000 m. As with its accuracy, the 
                        range of the M24 also varies slightly with the ammunition used. From 
                        a machine rest, the accuracy can be as low as .35 MOA.</font></p>

                        is highly unusual in having 5 grooves, rather than a more common 
                        even number. The logic behind this decision is that with no grooves 
                        or lands directly across from one another, deformation of the bullet 
                        is greatly reduced, theoretically resulting in greater accuracy. The 
                        actual accuracy of the M24 varies with the type of ammunition used, 
                        but is close to 1 MOA with match-grade ammunition at most distances. 
                        Though designed to maintain accuracy up to 10 000 rounds fired, the 
                        barrel reportedly demonstrates increasing accuracy up to that mark, 
                        which is retained even after 20 000 rounds are fired.</font></p>

                        With suitable ammunition it has an average group size of under 0.5 
                        MOA. The old model of the SSG 3000 had 
                        auxiliary iron sights for emergency use. However updated model lacks 
                        these sights. Even though it is no longer produced, 
                        the SSG 3000 remains a very competitive design. It might lack some 
                        bells and whistles of the latest sniper rifles, however in terms of 
                        performance it meets modern standards.</font></p>

                        International. This weapon is intended for 
                        highly trained special forces and elite law enforcement units. Since 
                        1999 it is used by the 
                        the British Special Air Service (SAS), Royal Marines and various special forces across the world.

                        predecessor, the Arctic Warfare sniper rifle. To design 
                        the AW50 Accuracy International combined the target shooting 
                        performance at competitions with toughness and ruggedness required 
                        for the military service. Without scope the AW50 weighs 13.5 kg 
                        including all accessories but with 
                        empty magazine. It&nbsp;has a hydraulic buffer system in its buttstock, so the 
                        recoil is reduced. In turn this feature increases accuracy and ease of 
                        operation.</font></p>

                        the 1980s. This weapon is based on the previous designs of the same 
                        company. However this sniper weapon was first adopted only in 2000 
                        by Canadian Armed Forces. This rifle is used by elite military and 
                        law enforcement units in various countries. The McMillan TAC-50 is 
                        used in Canada, France, Georgia, Israel, Jordan, Philippines, South 
                        Africa, Turkey and the United States. In Canadian service it is 
                        designated as the C15 Long Range Sniper Weapon. The TAC-50 is used 
                        by the US Navy SEALs, designated as the Mk.15.</font></p>

                        1968, during the Vietnam War. Perry's record was surpassed a few days 
                        later. In 2002 another Canadian sniper Rob Furlong made a kill in 
                        Afghanistan from 2 429 meters using the McMillan TAC-50. In 2009 
                        another record of 2 479 meters was set by a British sniper Craig 
                        Harrison in Afghanistan, using 
                        <a href="http://www.military-today.com/firearms/l115a3.htm">L115A3 sniper rifle</a>. However in 2017 
                        it was destroyed yet again by a Canadian sniper armed with McMillan 
                        TAC-50. Currently the longest recorded sniper kill in history was 
                        made with the McMillan TAC-50 rifle from 3 540 meters in Iraq. The 
                        shot was made by an unnamed Canadian sniper. The kill was verified

                        meters. This weapon outperforms the British Accuracy International

                        of you may wonder, why the CheyTac M200 Intervention sniper rifle 
                        was not mentioned on this TOP 10 list. Today it is the longest range sniper 
                        rifle in the world. It holds the world record for the best group (3 
                        bullets) at impressive 2 122 meter range. This weapon is effective out to a 
                        range of 1 830 meters. The Intervention is actually one of the best 
                        sniper weapons ever created. However for some reason is overlooked 
                        by the military.</font></p>

                        <font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; The Intervention rifle is used only by 
                        some elite units, such as the British SAS, Polish GROM, as well as 
                        Italian, Singaporean and Turkish special forces. Some sources report 
                        that the US Navy SEALs are also using this weapon. Despite its impressive performance this weapon is not 
                        that popular. 
                        Possibly the main reason is that extreme range of the CheyTac M200 
                        Intervention is not required in most tactical situations. Due to the 
                        large size of this weapon it is hard to move in and out of 
                        location. 
                        Also this weapon is too expensive to achieve widespread sales. There 
                        are some other sniper weapons, such as 
                        <a href="http://www.military-today.com/firearms/mcmillan_tac50.htm">McMillan TAC-50</a>, 
                        which is not that sophisticated and not that accurate, but holds the world's longest kill at 3 
                        540 
                        meters. Furthermore the McMillan TAC-50 is used by significantly more 
                        countries.</font></p>
